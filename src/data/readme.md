# Dataset Summary: Mozilla Flickr30k Transformed Captions (GPT-4o)

This dataset is a **de-biased version** of the original [Flickr30k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlphuji/flickr30k).  
It replaces human-written captions with **GPT-4o-generated alt_text** designed to reduce harmful bias.

## Key Features
- **31,014 images**
- **New field: `alt_text`** — rewritten image descriptions generated by GPT-4o  
- **Original field: `original_alt_text`** — list of 5 human captions per image  
- **Additional metadata**: `objects`, `filename`, `img_id`, `sentids`, `split`
- **Image modality**: JPEG images stored directly in the dataset

## Purpose
The dataset was curated to:
- reduce representational bias in image captions,
- provide consistent, neutral descriptions,
- serve as a safer benchmark for image–text models.

## How It Was Generated
The new captions were produced via GPT-4o using the script:
